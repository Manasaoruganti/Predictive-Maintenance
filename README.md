# Predictive-Maintenance
Developed a machine learning model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using NASAâ€™s
CMAPSS dataset for proactive maintenance. Preprocessed sensor data by calculating RUL, removing irrelevant features, and normalizing data to improve model
performance.
Trained multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost) and selected
Gradient Boosting Regressor based on accuracy.
Helps optimize maintenance schedules, reduce unexpected failures, and enhance operational efficiency by predicting
potential engine breakdowns.
